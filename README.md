Publicly available Monero Node to use to sync your wallets.
As always, it is a best practice to use your own local node whenever possible.

Using this node:

Select "Remote Node" in the Monero GUI software (Settings > Node > Remote Node > Add Remote Node)
or whatever wallet software/app you are using.

Enter http://node.richfowler.net (not https) as the URL, and the port number is 18089.
